# Quantum-Simulator-Multimodal-Selector

## Product overview

A container can take multiple routes to reach its destination and each route can have multiple modes of transport. Multimodal container assignment identifies the optimal route for each container, utilizing maximum possible track space and minimum operational cost.  The solution utilizes state of the art quantum computing algorithm (simulator based) for optimization, making it scalable and robust. This can help organizations in logistics and supply chain  to save on operational costs.

## Product Highlight 

* The solution uses state of the art quantum algorithm to select the fastest and most efficient routes with different transport modes and optimize on the cost and speed of transporting them to their destinations. This quantum computing based optimization is significantly faster than the conventional optimization approach.

* This solution can be used for large scale logistics operators like postal delivery systems, railway operators, airline transportation, supply chain, ecommerce, etc.
